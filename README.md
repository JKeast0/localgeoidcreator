# Local Geoid Creator
Calculating local geoid model with least square method

In geomatics we need physical height.And we take ellipsoidal heigth from GNSS.If we know some pivot points
orthometric and ellipsoidal heights we can calculate the geoid model of a project area.
On this project i codded the calculating surface of geoid with least square method.
Now i'm going to do android application of this.
