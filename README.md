# Local Geoid Creator
Estimating local geoid model GPS-levelling technique with JAVA.

In geomatics we need physical height.Physical height is elevation from mean sea level. We take ellipsoidal heigth from GNSS.
From the geoid determination techniques GNSS-levelling(geometric) method if we know some data points' orthometric and 
ellipsoidal heights we can estimate the geoid model of a project area. In this project we developed a program to estimate the
geoid surface of geoid with least square method. Now we are going to do android application of that.
