# Local Geoid Creator
Calculating local geoid model with least square method

In geomatics we need physical height.And we take ellipsoidal heigth from GNSS.If we know some pivot points'
orthometric and ellipsoidal heights we can calculate the geoid model of a project area.
In this project i made the program that calculates surface of geoid with least square method.
Now i'm going to do android application of that.
